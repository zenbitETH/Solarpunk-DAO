# Solarpunk-DAO
Developed at [DAO Hacks 2022](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/daohacks/solarpunk-dao-y0mjq)  
[Live Demo](https://solarpunkdao.vercel.app//)

## About
This project let Punk Cities' players have governance interactions based on the in-real-life places minted as NFTs on the game. Punk Cities' players can join Solapunk DAO and create proposals on their NFTs and get Energy on Chips deposited by the treasury to upgrade other places. 

This project uses Punk Cities ERC1155 contract to mint automatically energy and chips once a proposal is approved on the Solapunk Governance contract, it uses Punk Cities NFTs to match proposals to IRL places, we have used LearnWeb3 DAO contract as a template, we used Lens API components on Solarpunks repo for the frontend, we used IPFS to upload the profile and proposal image into IPFS and we have deployed the governance contract on Polygon Mumbai Testnet
